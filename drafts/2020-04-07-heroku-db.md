## Prerequisites
Previously, I cover what [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) is and how to use it for free for your blazor app. 
You need to go throug [the tutorial](https://nightbaker.github.io/blazor/heroku/webassembly/dotnet/2019/12/12/heroku-blazor/) and get familiar with steps how to create blazor app on heroku.

## Database

Today, I want to talk about database, which is must option to have in most cases for your apps. Fortunatelly, heroku offers free postgresql, which has limitations, but enough for you to start.
