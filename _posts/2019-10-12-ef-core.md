## Start point

In the previous [article](https://nightbaker.github.io/asp/net/core/mvc/view/partial/2019/10/04/asp-views/) we have learned how to works with views in asp.net core mvc.
Now, I want to add entity framework core support to my application.


First step is installing ef core package with sqlite provider.

```PowerShell
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
```

Secondly, let's add new folder `Data` in the root of project. Then, add new class with name `MoviesContext.cs` and following content

```csharp
public class MoviesContext : DbContext
{
    public MoviesContext(DbContextOptions options) : base(options)
    {
    }

    public DbSet<Movie> Movies { get; set; }
}
```

Also, you have to change in `Startup.cs` method `ConfigureServices`.

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddDbContext<MoviesContext>(options =>
    {
        options.UseSqlite("Filename=movies.db");
    });
    services.AddMvc();            
}
```

Now, we can execute command `add-migration first` in **Package Manager console**  in visual studio.

In the root of your project must be created `Migrations` folder with your `first` migration. As you can see migration contains 2 methods.

```csharp
 public partial class first : Migration
{
    protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
    {
        migrationBuilder.CreateTable(
            name: "Movies",
            columns: table => new
            {
                Id = table.Column<int>(nullable: false)
                    .Annotation("Sqlite:Autoincrement", true),
                Poster = table.Column<string>(nullable: true),
                Name = table.Column<string>(nullable: true),
                Author = table.Column<string>(nullable: true),
                Genre = table.Column<string>(nullable: true),
                CreatedAt = table.Column<DateTime>(nullable: false)
            },
            constraints: table =>
            {
                table.PrimaryKey("PK_Movies", x => x.Id);
            });
    }

    protected override void Down(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
    {
        migrationBuilder.DropTable(
            name: "Movies");
    }
}
```

`Up` method creates table with properties from `Movie` class

To apply this migration to database, we need to execute next command.

```powershell
update-database
```

After succesfull execution of this command. There will be new file `movies.db` in the root of your project. This is your sqlite database. 
Hovewer, you can use any database you want. Just select another ef provider.

In the previous article, we added initial data of our movies storage. Let's add this data to our newly created db using ef.
We should ovveride `OnModelCreating` method in our db context.

```csharp
public class MoviesContext : DbContext
{
    public MoviesContext(DbContextOptions options) : base(options)
    {
    }

    public DbSet<Movie> Movies { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<Movie>().HasData(new Movie
        {
            Id = -1,
            Author = "Todd Phillips",
            Genre = "Crime , Drama , Thriller",
            Name = "Joker",
            Poster = "https://dz7u9q3vpd4eo.cloudfront.net/admin-uploads/posters/mxt_movies_poster/joker_dabf394a-d4f2-4b68-90e2-011ed6b54012_poster.png?d=270x360&q=20",
            CreatedAt = new DateTime(2019, 10, 3)
        },
        new Movie
        {
            Id = -2,
            Author = "David Leitch",
            Genre = "Action , Adventure",
            Name = "Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw",
            Poster = "https://dz7u9q3vpd4eo.cloudfront.net/admin-uploads/posters/mxt_movies_poster/fast-furious-presents-hobbs-shaw_14d1ab4f-c90c-46d1-9e04-f7d69f285ebd_poster.png?d=270x360&q=20",
            CreatedAt = new DateTime(2019, 8, 2)
        },
        new Movie
        {
            Id = -3,
            Author = "Jon Favreau",
            Genre = "Adventure , Animation , Drama , Family , Musical",
            Name = "The Lion King",
            Poster = "https://dz7u9q3vpd4eo.cloudfront.net/admin-uploads/posters/mxt_movies_poster/the-lion-king_3904aadc-3a07-4836-892f-763b2dfdeea3_poster.png?d=270x360&q=20",
            CreatedAt = new DateTime(2019, 7, 19)
        },
        new Movie
        {
            Id = -4,
            Author = "Joachim RÃ¸nning",
            Genre = "Adventure , Family , Fantasy",
            Name = "Maleficent: Mistress of Evil",
            Poster = "https://dz7u9q3vpd4eo.cloudfront.net/admin-uploads/posters/mxt_movies_poster/maleficent-mistress-of-evil_c8507e61-a6b3-404d-b8c5-df6f74bc62be_poster.png?d=270x360&q=20",
            CreatedAt = new DateTime(2019, 10, 18)
        });
    }
}
```

Since, we changed db context , we must add new migration again. 

```powershell
add-migration dataSeed
```

Probably, you noticed that we used negative ids, the reason is otherwise entity framework says **The seed entity for entity type 'Movie' cannot be added because a non-zero value is required for property 'Id'. Consider providing a negative value to avoid collisions with non-seed data.**


Don't forget `update-database` command.

Finnaly, we should change our `MoviesControler` to using database as storage for movies.

```csharp
public class MoviesController : Controller
{
    private readonly MoviesContext _dbContext;

    public MoviesController(MoviesContext dbContext)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
    }

    public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
    {
        var movies = await _dbContext.Movies.ToListAsync();
        return View(movies);
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult Add()
    {            
        return View();
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Add(Movie movie)
    {
        

        _dbContext.Movies.Add(movie);
        await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync();

        var movies = await _dbContext.Movies.ToListAsync();

        return View("Index",movies);
    }

    public async Task<IActionResult> Search(string text)
    {
        text = text.ToLower();
        var searchedMovies = await _dbContext.Movies.Where(movie => movie.Name.ToLower().Contains(text)
                                        || movie.Genre.ToLower().Contains(text)
                                        || movie.Author.ToLower().Contains(text))
                                    .ToListAsync();
        return View("Index", searchedMovies);
    }

}
```

Let's run and check if all is working. Go to `/movies` and try to add new movie on `movies/add`. If you stop your app, your data should be persisted. 
And after restarting it, you can see your newly added movies still here.

## Conclusion

We added Entity framework support to our application. Also, learned about migrations and why we need them during our model is changed. We made sure, that **ef** allows to easily work with any relation database.
