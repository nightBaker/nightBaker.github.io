## Problem
We use ```IConfiguration``` interface to get access for information of sections and connection strings from our ```appsettings.json```. However, we also need to test our code by mocking this interface with our configurations.

## Solution

Letâ€™s look through example we have such appsetting.json
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "default": "value",
    "key1": "value"
  },
  "section1": {
    "key0": "value",
    "key1": "value"
  }
}
```

Firstly we need only connection string to test our method. ConnectionStrings is a section, so let's  start from mocking section

```c#

    var mockConfSection = new Mock<IConfigurationSection>();
    mockConfSection.SetupGet(m => m[It.Is<string>(s => s == "default")]).Returns("mock value");    
```
Now we can return our mocked section from GetSection method of ```IConfiguration``` interface.

```c#
    var mockConfiguration = new Mock<IConfiguration>();
    mockConfiguration.Setup(a => a.GetSection(It.Is<string>(s=>s == "ConnectionStrings"))).Returns(_mockConfSection.Object);
```

Briefly research gave me that answer. Even so , if we dive deeper, we may see that ```GetConnectionString``` extension method looks like

```c#
public static string GetConnectionString(this IConfiguration configuration, string name)
{
    return configuration?.GetSection("ConnectionStrings")?[name];
}
```

It means that this method uses literal and after use name of subsection, but if we look to the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-2.2#getsection-getchildren-and-exists) , we see that our full key is ```"ConnectionStrings:default"```

As the result of all above we may optimize our test code

```c#
_configuration = new Mock<IConfiguration>();
_configuration.SetupGet(x => x[It.Is<string>(s=>s == "ConnectionStrings:default")]).Returns("mock value");
```

That's enough.
